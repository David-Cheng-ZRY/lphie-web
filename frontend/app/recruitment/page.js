                <h3 className={styles.header2}>What is Rush?</h3>
                <p>Rush is a recruitment period at the beginning of the school quarter or semester when anyone interested in Greek life can attend events set up by a local chapter to meet its members and learn more about their organization. Rush usually lasts about 1-2 weeks, with events held every day that showcase various aspects of the fraternity.</p>

                <h3 className={styles.header2}>Should I attend all the rush events?</h3>
                <p>If you are serious about joining Lambda Phi Epsilon, you are highly encouraged to attend all rush events from beginning to end. Rush is designed to give interested individuals a glimpse into real fraternity life, so the more you experience and see for yourself, the better idea you will have of whether the fraternity is something you want to be a part of.</p>

                <h3 className={styles.header2}>Am I required to pledge if I attend rush?</h3>
                <p>No, there is no obligation for you to take action after rush has concluded. Rush is simply an opportunity for you to introduce yourself and become more familiar with the fraternity and the brothers.</p>

                <h3 className={styles.header2}>What happens after rush?</h3>
                <p>Upon attending rush, if you feel that Lambda Phi Epsilon may be a good fit for you, you can inquire further about the “bidding” process which usually includes a formal interview, followed by an invitation to pledge the fraternity.</p>

                <h3 className={styles.header2}>Will joining a fraternity impact my education?</h3>
                <p>While you are encouraged to learn more about the Greek system, we want you to remember why you are at school in the first place. Lambda Phi Epsilon's first and foremost purpose is to promote academic achievement and this priority is stressed even to prospective members. Like any worthwhile undertaking, joining a fraternity will most likely require some time and effort. Managing school and joining a fraternity is definitely possible, though, and part of becoming a Lambda is learning how to handle these challenges and become a responsible, well-rounded individual. The active members of the fraternity are students as well, and they will be committed to ensuring your academic success. Be sure to find the right balance to have a rewarding college life both academically and socially.</p>
